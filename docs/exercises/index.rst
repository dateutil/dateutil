Exercises
=========

It is often useful to work through some examples in order to understand how a module works; on this page, there are several exercises of varying difficulty that you can use to learn how to use ``dateutil``.

If you are interested in helping improve the documentation of ``dateutil``, it is recommended that you attempt to complete these exercises with no resources *other than dateutil's documentation*. If you find that the documentation is not clear enough to allow you to complete these exercises, open an issue on the `dateutil issue tracker <https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/issues>`_ to let the developers know what part of the documentation needs improvement.

Martin Luther King Day
--------------------------------


    `Martin Luther King, Jr Day <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day>`_ is a US holiday that occurs every year on the third Monday in January?

    How would you generate a :doc:`recurrence rule <../rrule>` that generates Martin Luther King Day, starting from its first observance in 1986?

Next Monday meeting
-------------------

    A team has a meeting at 10 AM every Monday and wants a function that tells them, given a ``datetime.datetime`` object, what is the date and time of the *next* Monday meeting? This is probably best accomplished using a :doc:`relativedelta <../relativedelta>`.

Parsing a local tzname
----------------------

    Three-character time zone abbreviations are *not* unique in that they do not explicitly map to a time zone. A list of time zone abbreviations in use can be found `here <https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/>`_. This means that parsing a datetime string such as ``'2018-01-01 12:30:30 CST'`` is ambiguous without context. Using :mod:`dateutil.parser` and :mod:`dateutil.tz`, it is possible to provide a context such that these local names are converted to proper time zones.

Problem 1
*********
    Given the context that you will only be parsing dates coming from the continental United States, India and Japan, write a function that parses a datetime string and returns a timezone-aware ``datetime`` with an IANA-style timezone attached.

    Note: For the purposes of the experiment, you may ignore the portions of the United States like Arizona and parts of Indiana that do not observe daylight saving time.

Problem 2
*********
    Given the context that you will *only* be passed dates from India or Israel, write a function that correctly parses all *unambiguous* time zone strings to aware datetimes localized to the correct IANA zone, and for *ambiguous* time zone strings default to India.
