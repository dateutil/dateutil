Rewrote ``tz.tzfile`` based on a backport of the ``zoneinfo`` module's pure-Python
implementation. This adds support for Version 2 and Version 3 ``tzfile(5)`` binaries,
resolving issues with timestamps beyond 2038 and "slim" format binaries.
Additionally, the new implementation improves PEP 495 compliance by correctly
handling the ``fold`` attribute during gaps in local time. Also added
``dateutil.tz.TZPATH`` and ``dateutil.tz.reset_tzpath`` to allow for runtime
configuration of the IANA time zone data search path.
